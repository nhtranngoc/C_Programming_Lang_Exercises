# Ex 6

Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers instead of array indexing. Good possibilities include `getline` (Chapter 1 and 4), `atoi`, `itoa`, and their variants (Chapter 2, 3 and 4), `reverse` (Chapter 3) and `strindex` and `getop` (Chapter 4.).

Note: Can't reverse `itoa` string for some reasons? Come back for this soon.
