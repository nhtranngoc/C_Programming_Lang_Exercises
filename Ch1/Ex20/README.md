# Ex 20

Detab

Replaces tab in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop.

__Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?__

n should be a symbolic parameter - since it behaves more like a constant, and will not be changed in the program.
