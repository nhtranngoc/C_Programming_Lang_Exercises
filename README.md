# C Programming Language Exercises

This is my attempt to go through K&R's The C Programming Language. All of the exercises will be done in sequence. 

As to not detract from the main purpose of this exercise I have decided not to use `makefile`. This will be left for another time. 

For now, all of the exercises are complied using 

`clang -std=c99 [file]`

Which should result in `a.out` (Unix) and `a.exe` (Windows)

# Testing
So far some of the exercises come with a test file, this could be either `.txt` or `.c`. To use, pipe file into binary stdinput: 

`cat test.txt | .\a.out`
