# C Programming Language Exercises

This is my attempt to go through K&R's The C Programming Language. All of the exercises will be done in sequence. 

As to not detract from the main purpose of this exercise I have decided not to use `makefile`. This will be left for another time. 

For now, all of the exercises are complied using 

`clang -std=c99 [file]`
